Run WordGramBenchmark for wordgrams of size 2-10 and record
the number of WordGram values/objects that occur more than
once as reported by the runs. For example, with WSIZE = 2,
which generates 2-grams, the output of benchmark and benchmarkShift
each indicates that the total # wordgrams generated is 177,634
and that the # unique wordgrams is 117,181

This means there are 177,634 - 117,181 = 60,453 WordGram values that
occur more than once. Find these same numbers/values for other orders
of k and complete the table below for different k-grams/different
values of WSIZE

WSIZE    # duplicates
2        60,453
3        10,756
4        1,987
5        667
6        362
7        226
8        151
9        105
10       73

=====
Explain in your own words the conceptual differences between
the benchmark and benchmarkShift methods.
Answer these questions:

(1) Why the results of these methods should be the same in
terms of changes made to the HashSet parameter passed to each method.

They both add the same words into the HashSet parameter. However, benchmark makes a new WordGram every iteration and benchmarkShift shifts the first WordGram until it reaches the same output.

(2) What are the conceptual differences between the two
benchmarking methods

benchmark creates a new object each time and benchmarkShift modifies the existing object

(3) We will now analyze and compare the amount of memory allocated for ALL arrays in the two methods.
For the benchmark() method, answer the following questions, giving answers in terms of variables such
as WSIZE and the number of words in the text, N:
    (a) Are there any String[] arrays created directly within the method? If yes, what are their sizes?
    You do not need to count ArrayLists.

    Yes the one string array created has size N

    (b) How many WordGram objects are created in total, either directly or indirectly? Note that the
    shiftAdd() method creates and returns a NEW WordGram object every time it’s called.

    The total number of WordGram objects is N-WSIZE

    (c) Each WordGram object stores a String[] array, created in the constructor, which takes up memory.
    What’s the size of this array for each WordGram?

    Each word gram is WSIZE

    (d) Does your shiftAdd() method create additional String[] arrays? If yes, what’s the total size of
    arrays created over all shiftAdd() method calls if applicable? (The answer may be different depending
    on your implementation.)

    shiftAdd() is never used in benchmark so there are no additional arrays

    (e) Based on your answers to (a)-(d), what’s the total amount of memory taken up by all String[] arrays,
    in terms of their total size?

    WSIZE*(N-WSIZE)+N

(4) Answer the same questions (a)-(e) from question (3) for the method benchmarkShift()

    (a)

    Yes the string array created is size WSIZE

    (b)

    The total amount is N-WSIZE

    (c)

    Each array is WSIZE

    (d)

    Yes it creates an additional array so the total size of arrays created is (N-WSIZE)*WSIZE

    (e)

    2*WSIZE*(N-WSIZE)+WSIZE

(5) Compare your answers for total memory from (3)(e) for benchmark() and (4)(e) for benchmarkShift().
Is the total amount of memory the same or different in benchmark() and benchmarkShift()? If different,
which one uses more memory?

benchmarkShift uses more memory; however, it is faster than benchmark because
